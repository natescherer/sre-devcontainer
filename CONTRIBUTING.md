# Introduction

Thanks for considering contributing to this project! My name is Nate Scherer, and I'm excited you're interested in improving something I've written.

I'm happy to consider any contributions, especially ones that add functionality or fix bugs.

## Ground Rules

I really only have one rule for contributions:

> This project is licensed under The MIT License, so your contribution will need to use the same license in order to be accepted.

If I accept your contribution, I'll add you to the Authors section in the README.

## How to Contribute

For contributions, please fork this project, make the changes/additions, and then issue a Pull Request.
Never done a pull request before? There's an easy tutorial [here](http://makeapullrequest.com/).

## How to report a bug

### Vulnerabilities

If you find a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an Issue. Instead, see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)

### Non-Security Bugs

For non-security bugs, please search GitHub issues to make sure someone else hasn't already reported the issue, and, if not, open an issue with the "bug" label containing the following information:

> 1. What release are you using?
> 1. What did you do?
> 1. What did you expect to see?
> 1. What did you see instead?

## How to suggest a feature or enhancement

If you wish to suggest a feature or enhancement, please search GitHub issues to make sure someone else hasn't already made the request, and, if not, enter an issue with the "enhancement" label.

## Code review process

As I'm just one person, and my GitHub projects are a side-project to my normal job, it may take me a while to review.

## Questions

If you have additional questions about contributing, please open a GitHub issue with the "question" tag.
